You are different but afraid to stand alone.
So go on, touch the screen, and blend with others.

You need to act like others.
Here is the result so far:
Try harder, touch the screen.

Find comfort in your social interactions.
You're getting better at it:
Try harder, touch the screen.

No one knew who you really are for a while.
Here is the result so far:
Try harder, touch the screen.

People hurt different people for no reason.
You're not being a part of it:
Hide your feelings, touch the screen.

Being different is a life threat.
You protected yourself for this long:
Hide who you are, touch the screen.

Sometimes you have to act like somebody else.
You're doing a good job of it:
Hide who you are, touch the screen.

You want to open up, be yourself.
But you can't.
Hide your feelings, touch the screen.

They don't like you because they don't know you.
Yet their prejudice is trying to kill you.
Hide who you are, touch the screen.

After all you've done, they still know who you really are.
But you're very good at this now:
Hide your feelings, touch the screen.

You're an invisible person.
But you can't find love this way.
It's hopeless, but touch the screen.

You're beautiful and different.
But no one can appreciate it.
Because they are not open-minded.

You want to be loved, be yourself.
But you're so good at hiding.
It's impossible now.

You completed the game. You're perfect at it.
Hiding who you really are, that is.
But you know you can't live like this any more.
The End.
